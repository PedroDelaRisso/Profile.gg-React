# **Profile.gg**

A proof of concept of a VALORANT player profiler made using React and the [Unofficial Valorant API](https://github.com/Henrik-3/unofficial-valorant-api) made by [Henrik-3](https://github.com/Henrik-3). It searches for your username and tag and displays statistics such as most played agent, playtime, total kills, etc. You can also customize the position of some of these stats. Since it uses the *unofficial API*, data is limited to the **last 10 matches of any account**.
